# Rock Paper Scissors Game in C
## Discription :-
    Here, I have made 'Rock_Paper_Scissors' game using 
    C language. This is my first mini project.

Rock Paper Scissors is a zero sum game that is usually played 
by two people using their hands and no tools. The idea is to 
make shapes with an outstretched hand where each shape will
have a certain power and will lead to an outcome.

    In this game user play the game with computer.
